# Form Tracking & Analytics
## How-to track any web form:
### Track & reduce form abandonment with [Insiteful™](insiteful.co?ref=gh_pages)

Want to save leads from visitors  that start to fill out your forms but don't finish? It doesn't have to be complicated. There's nothing more disheartening than missing out on a potential opportunity due to form abandonment or website drop-offs. For that reason, we created this tool  to easily track (and convert) leads from partial form-fill data with [Insiteful](insiteful.co?ref=gh_pages). In just a couple clicks, your web forms can have no more missed opportunities.™

For the hundreds of teams that close deals via web forms (i.e. orders, price quotes, support requests, contact), abandoned forms are a critical issue that directly impact bottom-line revenue. Unfortunately, many teams are forced to accept losing out on these opportunities, as the few WordPress plugins for partial form entry that exist today are baked into complicated & expensive platforms (i.e. form builders) that require expensive & tedious migration.

The good news is that the following simple steps can help you capture leads from any web forms without changing anything about your existing site:

## Installation

1. Create an account & login at [app.insiteful.co](https://app.insiteful.co?ref=gh_pages)
2. Visit the ["Domains"](https://app.insiteful.co/domains?ref=gh_pages) page and add your website (as indicated below)
